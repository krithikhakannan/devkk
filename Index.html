<h1>C is one of the oldest programming languages. C starts by calling a header file. We use user-defined functions in this space to divide two integers. We give the function heading.
Inside that we give a command to divide two integers a and b.

We then move on to the main function, using printf function to print the output of the  divided numbers . If zero is given for b, the compiler shows an error. It's simple math. Division by zero is not defined.
But when the the answer turns out to be a decimal value , we get  an integer.


So, well this is what pushing through a workshop has gotten me into writing c programmes.
